# Firebase Removal

The Firebase integration was removed from this project. The application now uses a simpler, in-memory state management approach with the AppContext.

If you need to implement a real backend:
1. Consider connecting to Supabase using Lovable's native integration
2. Set up authentication and database tables in Supabase 
3. Update the AppContext to use Supabase's client libraries

This will give you real database functionality, user authentication, and real-time updates.
